# Cognitive-Exercises v3

## Exercises
1. Graph: using short-term memory and working memory to search for the least cost paths between vertices.
2. Triangle: using short-term memory and working memory to solve a multi-step arithmetic task.
3. Recursive-Solving: using short-term memory and working memory to resolve partially recursive logic relations.
4. Puzzle-Solving: using short-term memory and working memory to resolve complex relations.

Notes:
1. There are no instructions, but there are `hint`/`answer` buttons.
2. Auto mode is initially enabled. This means that nothing needs to be changed at the very beginning.
3. The longer a person trains, the longer the effects last. If a person skips a week of intellectual activity, there will be a decline.
4. It is better to perform exercises in the evening and only when not tired. If exercises are done earlier, the brain may tire more quickly and the person will feel tired for the entire day.
5. Recursive-Solving and Puzzle-Solving exercises will be present in all subsequent versions, but Graph and Triangle may be replaced in the future.

## Motivation

To easily achieve what you want, you need to learn how to achieve what you want with diligence.

Rational and emotional thoughts have different sources in the human brain:  
- Rational thoughts, related to logical analysis, planning, and decision-making, are usually associated with activity in the frontal lobe of the brain.
- Emotional thoughts, related to emotions, feelings, and intuition, are often associated with activity in the limbic system of the brain.

We should separate these sources in order to better understand ourselves.  
Sometimes there may be conflicts that should be resolved by talking to yourself.  
You are able to influence yourself in a good way with your thoughts.  
Perhaps monks achieve this after many years of practice.

In addition, we should differentiate between thoughts "for the brain" and "for the body".  
The brain often tries to get happiness hormones for itself and thinks about the body infrequently. A person may eat tasty but unhealthy food: it feels good for the brain, but it can be bad for the body.  
1. The body doesn't decide how to live. The brain decides how to live for the body.
2. The brain cannot be transplanted into another body. A person will live in one body.
3. The brain should treat its body with the same attentiveness and care as it treats itself.

Take care of your body!

## Theory

Simplified model:
1. Sensory organs such as the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin receive signals from the external world and transmit them to the brain through the nervous system. In the brain, these signals are converted into impulses for complex neural networks.
2. The complex neural network is based on neurons and connections between them, which can be strengthened or weakened depending on frequency of use. On average, there are more than 86 billion neurons in the human brain, and the number of connections is even greater.
3. Impulses are transmitted from neuron to other neurons through specific connections between them, which have varying sensitivity to the impulses (including excitatory or inhibitory). Activation of a neuron by external stimuli is called evoked activity.
4. Neurons can generate their own impulses, called spontaneous activities. These activities occur in the absence of external stimulation of the neuron.
5. One neuron or a small group of neurons with connections do not store complete information, but the collective neural activations, connections, and processes between a large number of distributed neurons from different areas of the brain form a complete representation of information.
6. Information stored in the brain is distributed in different areas of the brain. It may be duplicated, be part of different representations and abstractions formed by the brain. Thanks to this distribution, information and its fragments can be partially restored even if access to some parts of it is lost; this process of restoration is called reconsolidation, and it is capable of altering memories.
7. During wakefulness, there is an increase in the level of activity of neurons and connections between them. Prolonged high activity can lead to fatigue and reduced brain efficiency. In such cases, sleep is necessary, during which the level of activity is restored, and other useful processes occur.
8. Neurogenesis is the process of formation of new neurons. Synaptogenesis is the process of formation of new connections between neurons. Neurons and connections between them are created in the early years of a person. In the future, their creation is possible, but to a much lesser extent. Physical activity, diet, social activity, and sleep can stimulate neurogenesis and synaptogenesis.
9. Neuroplasticity is the ability of neural networks in the brain to change through growth and reorganization. It is when the brain is rewired to function in some way that differs from how it previously functioned.
10. The brain's ability to adapt toward active functions allows humans to specialize in specific processes based on relative use and activity. For example, a right-handed person may perform any movement poorly with the left hand, but continuous practice with the non-dominant hand can cause one to become ambidextrous.
11. Short-term memory is characterized by increased activity of certain neurons and connections for several seconds, which has a minimal effect on the change of the neural network. The hippocampus is a brain region that is important for short-term memory and has also been implicated in emotion processing, spatial memory, memory consolidation (conversion of short-term memory into long-term memory).
12. Long-term memory is characterized by significant changes in the structure of the neural network (formation of new connections, strengthening of existing connections). Partial consolidation of memory occurs with sufficiently strong and prolonged excitation of neurons, for example, in cases of the emergence of emotions, repetition of information, physical exercise, and other forms of brain stimulation. More complete consolidation occurs during sleep (8 hours for full consolidation).
13. Recall is the process of retrieving information from the brain that is based on the activation of relevant neural networks. Recalling can be facilitated if the memorable information was linked to other information through multiple associations, including shared properties (such as shape, color, etc.), associated with a specific context (a person may remember something while being in roughly the same conditions as in the past), or had emotional significance.
14. Working memory is a complex mechanism necessary for processing information over a short period of time (usually a few seconds). Working memory is characterized by the sequential activation of many neurons in order to obtain any information. This can mean searching for and retrieving the necessary information from long-term memory, constructing a step-by-step solution for some task, etc.

Plausible hypotheses:
1. When we experience strong emotions, our brain remembers not only the event itself but also the associated details that would typically be forgotten. This memory occurs because the brain regions responsible for emotions send strong and prolonged impulses, exciting neurons and initiating long-term memory processes.
Based on: Joseph E. Dunsmoor, Vishnu P. Murty, Lila Davachi & Elizabeth A. Phelps. Emotional learning selectively and retroactively strengthens memories for related events // Nature. Published online 21 January 2015.
2. The synaptic tagging hypothesis suggests that during increased activity of specific neuronal connections (i.e., during short-term memory), synaptic tags are formed in these connections, which are stored for no more than 2-3 hours. These tags determine which connections were previously highly active and should be retained during long-term memory processes.
Based on: Frey, U., Morris, R. Synaptic tagging and long-term potentiation. Nature 385, 533–536 (1997).
3. The capacity of working memory is not limited by the number of elements that need to be memorized, but by the number of connections that can be formed between these elements. The more elements a person can link together in working memory, the higher their working memory capacity.
Based on: Oberauer K. Working Memory Capacity Limits Memory for Bindings. J Cogn. 2019 Sep 19;2(1):40. doi: 10.5334/joc.86. PMID: 31576379; PMCID: PMC6753309.

Practical statements:
1. The world is full of connections, the brain thinks in terms of connections, learning is the process of building new connections based on existing ones, science is about finding connections in the universe. Connections are a unifying concept of patterns, associations, relations, etc. Therefore, for self-improvement, a person should always connect pieces of information in an explicit and understandable way.
2. Any brain training involves activating neurons. Activated neurons are associated with the types of tasks that the brain solves. However, this may not have a big impact on solving other types of tasks. Therefore, a person should not limit themselves to a narrow range of tasks for brain training.
3. Cognitive flexibility and correct knowledge are important. Without cognitive flexibility, a person's ability to learn new information and adapt to changing circumstances is limited. Without correct knowledge, a person's understanding of the world may be distorted or incomplete, leading to ignorance and potentially harmful beliefs or actions. A person can be good in the first and bad in the second, and vice versa; however, one should not evaluate a person's intelligence by only one of them.
4. Retrieval of information is a more effective memory strategy than simple repetition by reading. If the goal is to remember certain information, it is necessary to retrieve it more frequently.
5. To remember a large amount of information, it is recommended to break it down into several parts and distribute time between them in such a way that every 3 hours are devoted to the most closely related topics (the less diversity in information, the better the distribution of resources for long-term memory processes). It is also important to ensure that the topics studied between these periods are also closely related. Breaks for rest should be taken every hour, and a long break should be taken every 3 hours. The best option for a long break is sleep (even 1 hour of sleep is beneficial).
6. It is recommended to sleep for at least 8 hours at night to ensure complete memory consolidation.
7. The brain adapts to everyday tasks. A person should choose a field of activity and develop in it. This is the most profitable option for self-development; narrow-focused exercises may not have a significant effect on a person's main activity.

### Streaming

A person can recall the sound of birds chirping, the taste of freshly picked berries, or the scent of blooming flowers, even years after the initial experience. Imagining delicious food, pleasant smells, interesting melodies, and virtual reality in general can be beneficial for the brain, because the corresponding connections become more active and sensitive to new experiences.

Visualization is especially important.  
If you don't visualize, you lose your potential.

To achieve some success in self-development, it is enough for a person to perform the "Streaming" exercise — imagine a virtual world in their head, simulating the work of all senses.  
The more detailed their imagination, the better the effect they will achieve.  
In addition, a person should include active speaking in this process so that the connections between different areas of the brain are also linked to the parts of the brain associated with speech.

The basic version of the exercise is imagining the sequence of events in a day.  
Also this exercise can be used to think about any tasks and solutions to them.

Talking to yourself is similar to the Streaming process.  
You can ask yourself questions and answer them in detail.  
You can identify your problems based on your answers to your own questions.  
Streaming is a powerful technique that should become fundamental in self-development.

### Connections

Connections are a unifying concept of patterns, associations, relations, etc.

If a person needs to remember certain data, the brain must find and build connections between the elements of that data.  
For example:
1. The sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 is easy to remember because the pattern is immediately apparent: the range [1, 9] with a step of 1.
2. The sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 8 is also easy to remember (but slightly harder) because the pattern is immediately apparent: the range [1, 9] with a step of 1, swap 8 and 9.
3. The sequence of numbers 5, 2, 8, 3, 4, 7, 6, 1, 9 is harder to remember because the pattern is not immediately apparent.

```
1   5   9
 2 4 6 8
  3   7
```

Rehearsing and memorizing by heart without linking with the knowledge/experience available in the brain is a bad strategy because it is costly and unreliable.  
This strategy is acceptable only if you have dry data in which you cannot find connections.  
In all other cases, you need to build connections with the information that is already in the brain.

The most important thing is to avoid false or incomplete (unproven or unsubstantiated) connections.  
Such connections can lead to many problems.

Intuitive problem solving is also a bad strategy.  
The intuitive strategy assumes that a person will think about whatever comes to mind automatically and uncontrollably.  
Intuition can produce irrational thoughts, which can lead to problems.  
If the thinking process is explicit, the probability of error significantly decreases.

Example of explicit thinking process.  
A man wants to buy a certain item at a store. What does he need to consider?
1. He needs to understand the essence of the connections: money is needed for purchases; a car is needed to get to the required store; the car must be fully prepared...
2. He needs to make initial assumptions or precise judgments: there is money in the wallet, it is currently working hours, so the stores are open; the car is ready to go...
3. He needs to search for thought paths throughout the thought process: do I need to fill up the car with gas? do I need to take out the trash? do I need to bring bags? do I need to plan an alternate route due to possible traffic?...

As a result, a person builds a possible solution or solutions.  
For example: the car needs to be fueled, the keys, bag, and wallet with money need to be taken...

Thus, thinking process should be explicit.

## Popular ideas on the Internet

### [Mnemonic technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic)

Category: good.  
Mnemonic technique is a specific case of searching for and memorizing connections.  
Mnemonic technique is closely related to the theory described above.

### [Relational Frame Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_frame_theory)

Category: good.  
A person learns to use those connections that are often used in the human world.  
RFT is closely related to the theory described above.

Real examples:

### [Spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)

Category: good.  
See [https://gwern.net/spaced-repetition](https://gwern.net/spaced-repetition):
1. Don't use spaced repetition if you need it sooner than 5 days or it's worth less than 5 minutes.
2. For massed repetition (not spaced repetition), the average time after memorization at which one has a 50% chance of remembering the memorized item seems to be 3-5 days.
3. Expanding spacing is roughly as good as or better than (wide) fixed intervals, but expanding is more convenient.
4. The research favors questions which force the users to use their memory as much as possible; in descending order of preference: free recall, short answers, multiple-choice, [cloze deletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test), recognition.

### [N-Back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-back)

Category: questionable.  
Notes:
1. Exercise to develop working memory should not emphasize rehearsal of meaningless (unrelated) information as the primary method of influencing working memory. The human world sets thinking in connections, rather than a meaningless approach to information. Working memory is not about numerical volume, but about the sequential activation of many neurons in order to obtain information.
2. N-Back is closely related to [Digit span task](https://www.psytoolkit.org/library/digitspan.html), [Corsi task](https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/corsi2.html), [Backward Corsi task](https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/backward_corsi.html), [PASAT](https://4skinskywalker.github.io/PASAT/) ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paced_Auditory_Serial_Addition_Test)).

### [Miller's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two)

Miller's law is incorrect because it does not take into account the time and the connections between elements (because this depends on how well a person can connect certain data elements in the brain). Rehearsal takes time, but searching for connections in data can speed up the process (that's why some people use mnemonics).

### [Raven's Matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices)

Raven's Matrices are tasks used to evaluate a person's ability to find and apply relations by analogy.

Let's say we have a [Raven matrix](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297730025_Constructive_Solving_of_Raven%27s_IQ_Tests_with_Analogical_Proportions).

Attributes:  
a1 : rectangle; a2 : triangle; a3 : circle;  
b1 : horizontal; b2 : vertical; b3 : diagonal.

Pattern:  
a1b2 a2b1 a3b2  
a2b1 a3b2 a2b3  
a3b2 a2b3 ?  

Answer: a1b2.

The first two lines define the rule.  
Human task: find and apply relations by analogy.

Although the idea of Raven matrices is good, the kinds of connections between matrix elements are memorizable.  
And this means that intelligence cannot be accurately assessed according to the Raven matrices.

### Exercises on platforms for brain development

If the basis on which the training is based is not written on the platforms, then such platforms should be avoided.  
If there is no basis, it means that the creators are guided by ideas that they are not aware of.
Look at many judgments about intelligence from a critical point of view.
